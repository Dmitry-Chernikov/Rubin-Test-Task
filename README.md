# Rubin-Test-Task
Test task for a microcontrollers programmer
Task 1. Choose and distribute the following types of signals by microcontroller.
- 3 tactive signals;
- 15 voltage measurements (MV);
- 15 digital signals;
2. Task 2: assign their name to each measured signal at their discretion.
Task 3. Write an algorithm for comparison 15 of the measured voltage values ​​on the identification of the highest value and issue information on a segment panel in the form of a digital signal.
Task 4: set the time of re -passage of the algorithm every 5 seconds. After 10 repeated passages of the algorithm, stop issuing information to a seven -segmet indicator and issue a control signal to a transistor, which opens the LED transfer circuit and, accordingly, its sunbathing.
Conditions: microcontroller K1986BE1Q
Semicigmeting panel Als324A1
